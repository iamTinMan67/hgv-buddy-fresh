On each new job allocation lets add new fields for load dimensions consisting of; length, width,  height, weight, notes. a checklist of question prompts are  displayed when hovering over a field before adding data to particular fields. So for instance when the user enters the length, height, width fields a message hint appears and lists is the load over-sized, protruding, balanced, fragile for each part of a consignment. the allocated plot space (cubage) of that does not conform to the following:


Cubage Script

1. Full Plot consists of weight = 1200kg, length = 1200mm, width = 1200mm, height = 2200mm costs £65;
2. Light plot consists of weight = 750kg, length = 1200mm, width = 1200mm height = 2200mm costs £60;
3. Euro half weight = 500kg, length = 1200mm, width = 1200mm, height = 2200mm costs £55;
4. Half Plot consists of weight 500kg, length = 1200mm, width = 800mm, height = 800mm costs £50,
5. Quarter Plot consists of weight = 250kg length = 1200mm, width = 1000m, height = 800mm costs £45;
6. Mini Plot consists of weight = 150kg, length = 1200mm, width 1200mm, height = 600mm costs £40.

If a load exceeds the dimensions allocated for length = 1200mm or width 1000mm then an Over-sized plot will be applied or height of a quarter plot then the plot rate standard should be based on cubage and weight @ 18.46 per kg. Tail-lift drops cost extra @ 7.50 each plot.
