# 🏢 Multi-Tenant Business Model

## 🎯 Proper Business Structure

### **✅ Super Admin (You - Tom)**
- **Role**: `supa_admin`
- **Access**: Full backend control, can manage multiple businesses
- **Purpose**: Application owner, can create/manage different haulage companies
- **Database**: `super_admins` table + `users` table

### **✅ Staff Members (Adam + All Other Staff)**
- **Role**: `staff` (or specific roles like `driver`, `manager`, `admin`)
- **Access**: Frontend application access only
- **Purpose**: Day-to-day operations of their specific haulage company
- **Database**: `staff_members` table + `users` table (for auth only)

## 🔄 Updated Authentication Flow

### **For You (Super Admin):**
```
Login → Supabase Auth → users table (role: supa_admin) → Full access
```

### **For Adam & Other Staff:**
```
Login → Supabase Auth → users table (role: staff) → Frontend access only
```

## 🏗️ Multi-Tenant Architecture Benefits

### **✅ Scalability:**
- One application can serve multiple haulage companies
- Each company has their own staff members
- You maintain control over the entire platform

### **✅ Security:**
- Only you have backend admin privileges
- Staff members can only access their company's data
- Clear separation of concerns

### **✅ Business Model:**
- You can onboard new haulage companies
- Each company pays for their usage
- You control the platform, they control their operations

## 📊 Current User Roles

| User | Email | Role | Access Level |
|------|-------|------|--------------|
| Tom | tomboyce@mail.com | `supa_admin` | Full backend + frontend |
| Adam | adam.mustafa1717@gmail.com | `staff` | Frontend only |

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Run the update script**: `database/update_adam_to_staff.sql`
2. **Test Adam's access**: Ensure he can only access frontend features
3. **Verify security**: Confirm Adam cannot access backend admin functions
4. **Plan for expansion**: Ready to onboard new haulage companies

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Ensures staff only see their company's data
- **Role-based Access**: Clear separation between super admin and staff
- **Data Isolation**: Each company's data is properly isolated
- **Audit Trail**: Track who created/modified what data

This structure properly reflects a SaaS business model where you own the platform and businesses use it for their operations.
